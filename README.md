In this example, we have a function integrate_with_third_party_api that demonstrates integration with a hypothetical third-party API. Here's how the code works:

The function integrate_with_third_party_api takes data as input, which represents the data to be sent to the third-party API.

The payload dictionary is created to structure the data in a format expected by the third-party API.

A POST request is made to the third-party API using the requests library. The URL 'https://api.example.com/endpoint' represents the endpoint of the third-party API.

The response from the third-party API is checked. If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), the result is extracted from the response using response.json(). You can perform further processing with the result as needed.

If the response status code is not 200, an error message is printed indicating the failure and the status code.

Finally, an example usage is demonstrated where data_to_send represents the data to be integrated with the third-party API. You can customize the data structure and fields to match the requirements of the specific third-party API you are integrating with.

This code snippet demonstrates a basic integration with a third-party API using the requests library. You can modify it based on the specific APIs and data formats you need to integrate with within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem
